There are two modes:

* Jump mode: Screen is covered by 3letter codes; typing a code moves
  pointer to the position of the code. This mode is initially activated.
  You can exit it by typing the complete code, pressing escape. Pressing
  backspace undo the last typed letter, when no letter is typed, backspace
  exits the mode as well.

* Normal mode: You can move the pointer by h,j,k,l keys (vi-like) or
